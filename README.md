What doesn't work: Motherboard's Bluetooth and WiFi, I used [this](https://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/usb-adapter/ub400/) dongle to make Bluetooth work and I mainly use ethernet so didn't need WiFi.
And I used a USB to 3.5mm jack converter to make my headphone work, But with Bluetooth you can use any wireless one.
